## Why did we build Flare?

Our team (Just me lol) believe that gaming should be available to everybody, not just people who have fancy computers, and even if it is basic web games, the opportunity to be able to play these games ANYWHERE, launching them offline, gives endless capabilities.

## **Uses**
There are a couple of uses for Flare, but here are the main ones.

### Gaming away from home. 
Whether you on a plane, train, car, or even just a friend's house, after booting Flare up for the first time, you can do it anywhere. This can allow any device to become a portable tool for gaming.

### In school use
In school, the gaming potential is great. A blocker can still access Flare's links, but if you have an unblocked link, you can open the site up completely undetected from teachers, without having to worry about them seeing your screen.
